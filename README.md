# Preamble

## Adding to this list
To add to this list, use the [example template](#example-item) provided, and add it to table of contents at the top.

Note you may add new categories if there are multiple items in Miscellaneous that make sense in their own category.

# Unix
*Unix-y programs, tools, or information*

## Floppy's Neovim Config
*Floppy's neovim config, focused on Go, Rust and Elm. 10 times better than isaac's*

[floppy-nvim](https://github.com/nixnest/Awesome/tree/master/Unix/floppy-nvim)

explanation of what the config adds/does would go here.

## Sky's comma scripts (inspired by Brandon Rhodes)

*Some useful scripts, most to simplify git operations*

[sky-bin](https://github.com/nixnest/Awesome/tree/master/Unix/sky-bin)

Rationale behind the comma: https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2009/commands-with-comma/

## Flippy's i3 config
*A basic i3-wm configuration with some meaningful additions*

[flippy-i3](https://github.com/nixnest/Awesome/tree/master/Unix/flippy-i3)

This is a basic i3 configuratation for general use. Features are listed below.
- Super+u to open a dropdown terminal. Default is Termite.
- Super+Shift+s to take a screenshot. Uses scrot by default.
- Super+z opens a terminal with zsh instead of the default shell.
- All arrow key functions are removed, and jkl; is replaced by hjkl for the real vim experience. 
- Has lines for gaps with i3-gaps, but you can remove these if you use vanilla i3. 
- Starts polybar at the bottom of the file. Change this to reflect the name of your bar.
- Sets wallpaper with feh. Change this to your own wallpaper.
- Starts nm-applet and compton.
- Thinkvantage button on thinkpads will open Neomutt.

# Programming
*Javascript not allowed*

## Zack's Nixnest Image Host
_Modified from Fish's personal image host to support API keys and whatnot. Written in NodeJS. Also comes with a terrible bash script for adding new users._
[Nixnest-Imagehost](https://github.com/nixnest/Awesome/tree/master/Programming/Nixnest-Imagehost)

# Miscellaneous
*Something that doesn't belong anywhere else*

## Example Item
*Give a short (under 100 character) summary of what this is.*

[Now give a relevant link to what this is](https://example.com/)

Now for the rest of this, you may give a much more indepth explanation or even a tutorial.
